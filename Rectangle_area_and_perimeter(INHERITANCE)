/*13)  You are assigned to develop a basic geometry application that calculates the area and perimeter of shapes, specifically a rectangle. Follow the instructions below to implement the required functionality:

Define a base class Shape with a constructor that takes two parameters, representing the dimensions of the shape (length and width), implement a method named calculateArea in the Shape class that calculates the area of a rectangle using the formula:
Area=length*width
Create a child class named Rectangle that inherits from the Shape class. In the Rectangle class, implement a method named calculatePerimeter that calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
perimeter=2*(length+width)

Input Format:
Two integers, each on a new line, representing the length and width of the rectangle.

Output Format:
The first line is the integer representing the area of the rectangle.
The second line is the integer representing the perimeter of the rectangle.

    self.width=width
  def calculateArea(self):
    return self.length*self.width
class Rectangle(Shape):
  def calculatePerimeter(self):
    return 2*(self.length+self.width)

if __name__=="__main__":
  length=int(input())
  width=int(input())
  rectangle=Rectangle(length,width)
  area=rectangle.calculateArea()
  perimeter=rectangle.calculatePerimeter()
  print(area)
